# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a modified version of recurrent
neural networks, which makes it easier to remember past data in memory. The
vanishing gradient problem of RNN is resolved here.

Why did I prefer LSTM in this project implementation?

LSTMs are a special type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). As we already
know, RNNs are a broad category of neural networks with feedback loops, and are
capable of “remembering” and using information about previous inputs.
